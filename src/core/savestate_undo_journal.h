/**
 * Between a Quick Save and a Quick Load, remembers how to undo changes the guest makes to state a
 * savestate does not hold, so a Quick Load can put that state back as it was at the save. The
 * restored guest memory refers to that state by value. Measured when the player dies in Super
 * Mario 3D World: the game frees its 192 level buffers and creates them again at the same memory,
 * but under new nvmap handle ids and at new GPU addresses (a load that only rewound memory drew a
 * black scene), and it unmaps the stacks of four worker threads and maps new ones elsewhere (the
 * next death after such a load aborted when the game unmapped a stack the kernel no longer had).
 *
 * A change it cannot undo makes the journal unusable until the next save: a Quick Load then
 * refuses instead of loading onto state that does not match.
